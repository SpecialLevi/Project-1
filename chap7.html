        <p>I've known about the 90/10 ratio for a long time, but Robert gives us all a good reminder.
           Pretty soon, fi we don't start paying attention, it could reach the 95/05 ratio or even
           99/01 with 1 percent of the people owning 99 percent of the nation's assets.
           Winners wouldn't let that happen, and i hope that includes you</p>
