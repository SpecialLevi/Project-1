        <p>There are many definitions of intelligence. One of the more practical ones i learned form my
           rich dad is, <q>intelligence is the ability to solve problems.</q> For example, in school, 
           if you can solve math problems, you are considered intelligent. Out of school, if you can fix
           a car, you are deemed to have automative intelligence. When it comes to money, the bigger
           financial problems you can solve, the higher your financial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>Today, our world faces some serious financial problems. Many are interrelated problems, one
           causing the other. Some of the more pressing ones are:
           <ol>
               <li>Value of the dollar falling</li>
               <li>National debt increasing</li>
               <li>Baby boomers starting to retire</li>
               <li>Gap increasing between the rich and everyone else</li>
           </ol>
        </p>

        <p>When Robert and I were talking about the Shrinking middle class, it made me aware that Some
           things can be explained. It's like an hourglass with the middle class the pinched part, or
           like someone with a very small waistline.
