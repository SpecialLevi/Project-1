        <p><i>Dallas, Texas: February 19, 2006</i></p>
        <p>Once again, on Sunday afternoon, the black limo pulls up to the backstage entrance
           of The Learning Annex's Real Estate Expo. Once again, the excitement builds as words
           spreads, <q>The Donald is here.</q> And once again, the police escort comes in first 
           to clear the way, two lines from, and Mr. Trump walds the gauntlet of adoring fans.

        <p>As Robert says, <q>We as a nation cannot solve a large financial crisis wit the same old thinking.</q>
           I couldn't agree more. This entitlement mentality is everywhere. in fact, it has become epidemic
           in our economy.
        </p>
        <p>I guess we've all probably heard the term <q>groupthink</q> by now. It's htat old herd mentality
           htat seems to bring out the best and the worst in people. By the best, I mean that sometimes
           a shepherd will surface. But that's an unlikly scenario. It's usually the wolves that will
           surface first, and the herd will be primed and ready to follow.
