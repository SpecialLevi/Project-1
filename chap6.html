        <p>Donald and I share the same concerns, and we want you to be rich, so what
            are our solutions?</p>
        <p>One day, during a brief meeting in his office, Donald simply said, 
           <q>I invest to win. Don't you?</q> With that statement, the difining difference appeared.
           He and I invest to win, while others invest not to lose.</p>
        <p>We've talked here about the advice, <q>Save money, get out of debt, invest for the 
           long term (generally in mutual funds) and diversify.</q> Late that afternoon, Donald
           and I discussed how we did not focus on saving money. In fact, we are both millions 
           of dallars in debt - but good debt. </p>

        <p>I've known about the 90/10 ratio for a long time, but Robert gives us all a good reminder.
           Pretty soon, fi we don't start paying attention, it could reach the 95/05 ratio or even
           99/01 with 1 percent of the people owning 99 percent of the nation's assets.
           Winners wouldn't let that happen, and i hope that includes you</p>
