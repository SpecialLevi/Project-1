        <p><i>Chicago: November 6, 2005</i></p>
        <p>It is early Sunday afternoon. Tens of thousands of people are attending a
           large Real Estate Exposition put on by The Learning Annex in Chicago. The 
           convention hall is filled with exhibits and displays of wealth building 
           investments and opportunities. In smaller classrooms, instructors are sharing 
           their knowledge about how the attendees can build thier own personal fortunes. 
           Thie cavernous hall is filled with a buzz that is contagious. People are excited
           about what they are learning and how it can alter their financial destinies.

        <p>The first time i met Robert Kiyosaki was one of those big surprises that life likes
            to give us now and then. I knew of Robert's credentials, namely having sold millions
            of books and remaining on The New York Times best seller list for five years. These 
            are no simple accomplishments. I expected him to be a powerhouse, and an intimidating one at that.
